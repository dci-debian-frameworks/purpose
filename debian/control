Package: libkf5purpose-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libkf5purpose5 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Provides an abstraction to provide and leverage actions of a specific kind, devel file
 Purpose offers the possibility to create integrate services and actions on
 any application without having to implement them specifically. Purpose will
 offer them mechanisms to list the different alternatives to execute given the
 requested action type and will facilitate components so that all the plugins
 can receive all the information they need.
 .
 This package contains the Purpose development files.
